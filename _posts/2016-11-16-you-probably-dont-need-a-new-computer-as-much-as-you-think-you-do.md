**Confession: I really want one of the new Macbook Pros** They are so sleek looking and the thought of being able to drive multiple 4k monitors just sounds awesome. But I don’t have $2,500 to spend on a new laptop. *In fact, I don’t have $500 to spend on a new laptop.*

’m typing this on a 2007 Macbook. Not a Macbook Pro. Just the plain, white Macbook my wife bought new in 2007. This Macbook sits in my church office in permanent docked mode — connected to an old monitor I have (I think I purchased it in 2007 as well), a mouse and keyboard. It is my primary machine for doing church related work.

When I’m on the go, I usually use my Chromebook (The Macbook is kind of heavy) and I have a souped up Mac Mini in my home office I use mostly for Web Development stuff. But as far as church work, I get by just fine on the old Macbook.

I’ve maxed out the ram. I switched out the hard drive for a tiny SSD. I use it in docked mode and don’t really worry about the battery.

I can’t upgrade the OS. Current Apple computers are running Mac OS 10.12. This one is running 10.7. There is plenty of software that it cannot run, including the current versions of Photoshop, Google Chrome, Safari, Affinity Designer, Sketch, etc. *It doesn’t matter.* I don’t need any of that stuff for my church office computer. **I just need to be able to access the internet, record audio, write and print.**

I do my writing in [Dropbox Paper](http://dropbox.com/paper), which runs just fine in the latest version of [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/firefox). I record audio using [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm), which works fantastic on older machines, and the old mac can run [Create Booklet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/create-booklet/id943029046?mt=12) and has Mac’s fantastic print dialogues which makes it great for printing bulletins, handouts, manuscripts, etc.. It runs web software just fine, so almost anything I can do on my Chromebook I can do just as well on my old Macbook, but it gives me a full operating system, better printing, and the ability to run audio software.

I guess what I’m trying to say is you don’t need to have crazy expensive hardware for everything. Sometimes you can get by just fine with something old, something used or something cheap.

*I'd still love that new Macbook Pro though.*
