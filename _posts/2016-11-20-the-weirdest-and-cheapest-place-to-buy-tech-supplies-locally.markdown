Do you know what I end up buying ALL THE TIME?

Cables.

HDMI cables. Ethernet Cables. USB cables. Audio cables. I need these almost every month and often, I need them *yesterday*.

If you’ve never shopped for these at the logical places (Best Buy, Staples, Radio Shack, Wal-Mart) prepared to get sticker shock. HDMI cables are north of $20. Ethernet cables north of $10. USB and audio cables are similarly expensive.

Of course, the best place to buy these cables and supplies is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Cat5e-Ethernet-Patch-Cable/dp/B003O973OA/ref=sr_1_9?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1479340700&sr=1-9&keywords=ethernet+cable). There, an [HDMI cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Standard/dp/B014I8SSD0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1479340663&sr=8-3&keywords=hdmi+cable) can cost $7 instead of $20 and an [ethernet cable](https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Cat5e-Ethernet-Patch-Cable/dp/B003O973OA/ref=sr_1_9?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1479340700&sr=1-9&keywords=ethernet+cable) will cost $6 instead of $10.

But what if you need it now — not two days ago?

Don’t go to Staples or Best Buy. Go to **Home Depot** first.

Yes. that Home Depot.

Surprisingly, not only can you get a good deal on 2x4s and paint. You can get a good deal on a surprisingly good selection of electronic cables. Just go to the electronic section (where you would buy extension cords) and you should see an entire wall of cables that are much cheaper than they are at Best Buy or Staples.

They usually won’t be as low as they would be on Amazon, and they certainly don’t have as good a selection, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much they do carry and how much better their selection is than more logical stores and the price difference is almost always substantial enough to justify the trip.

Home Depot…I would have never guessed.
