I want to be clear, I'm still making websites.  All of my sitesfor.church customers will still have my attention.  **I've just decided to offer my services through [Ryan Hayden: Digital Designer](http://ryanhaydenwebsites.com) instead of through sitesfor.church.**  In fact, if you visit [sitesfor.church](http://sitesfor.church) it will bring you to this site.

#### Why the change?

I've been thinking about this for the last three months and I have several reasons:

### 1. I always hated the name sitesfor.church

I made the decision to start sitesfor.church kind of hastily.  I was making websites for a lot of people and I was podcasting at the time, and I thought it would be weird to promote my name on the podcast - so I bought the first domain name I thought of and I've regretted it ever since.

There are lots of reasons I hate the name:

* The name is kind of weird.  It's always been kind of weird.  
* It's not grammatically correct.  (Shouldn't it be sitesforchurches?)  
* People aren't very familiar with .church domain names.  

In contrast to sitesfor.church, I'm kind of partial to the name "Ryan Hayden."  It's suited me well for the last 33 years and I think I'll keep it.

### 2. I make websites for more than just churches

I've done a lot more work for missionaries lately than I have for churches.  I've also been doing a little bit of work for businesses.  Sitesfor.church doesn't really work as a domain for that.

On my new site, right on the header I can direct people to different pages for missionary sites, church sites, as well as for business sites.

### 3. I'm not wanting to be a startup business

My original plan for sitesfor.church was to be a growing startup business that taught Bible College students to setup and maintain websites.  I threw myself into starting a business.  It cost a lot of money (I didn't even break even) and when push came to shove, I was still doing 99% of the work.

This wasn't the fault of the people I was working with:  It just turns out that training people who are not web designers to design and update websites took a ton of my time and I was never really successful at it.  I'm super grateful to the "site-reps" who gave it a try, and I hope they learned to love web work.

So, I've decided to continue to offer websites to churches but make no pretensions about it being anything but just me.

### 4. I want to focus more on custom design

Towards the end of last year, I came to the conclusion that traditional church websites (slider at the top, curated blog list, upcoming events, etc.) didn't serve most churches well and I began working on a new template that could serve as a base for more custom designs.

Every website I've made since November (including this one) has been based on this foundation, and I plan on using it almost exclusively going forward.

But how do you show that in a template list?  

The way this theme is designed, every single site looks different.  So, I've decided to just get rid of the template list altogether.

### 5. I wanted a fresh start

I've been working on what I called "Sitesfor.church version 2" - basically changing the way most of the content on the websites is updated and adding several new features.  Essentially, it's easier to just start from scratch with a new name than try to rewrite all of my old stuff.

Also, I wanted to do some new things with pricing, with blogging, and with some giveaways that didn't fit sitesfor.church.  This has been really easy under this domain.
