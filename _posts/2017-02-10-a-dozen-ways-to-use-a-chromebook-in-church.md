Chromebooks are dirt cheap. (I bought one for my daughters for $120 at Christmastime.) They are also rock solid little machines that usually have nice hardware. When you buy a Chromebook, you’ll never have to worry about viruses or malware, and they tend to do a really good job of not slowing down over time. (The Chromebook I’m typing this on has only gotten better over the last year and a half.)

I’m a big advocate of Chromebooks and Chromeboxes (basically desktop Chromebooks) for most people. Now, that all new Chromebooks run Android apps out of the box, there is very little you won’t be able to do well on a Chromebook. (Printing is still a problem, but it’s quickly getting better.)

I’ve thought of a list of dozen ways you can use one of these cheap laptops to enhance your ministry. If you don’t have a computer around the church, or don’t have the budget to invest in something like a Mac or nice Windows computer, you can still do quite a bit with this small investment.

## 1. Use it for slides for Sunday School or even church

In our church,[ we do slides](/2016/11/15/the-simple-mindsets-that-lead-to-awesome-slides.html) every Sunday, and I run the slides off of my Chromebook. [I just connect it to an HDMI cable on our front pew and turn it around so I can see it](http://ryanhaydenwebsites.com/church/tech/2016/11/15/how-to-get-screens-in-your-church-for-less-than-900.html). I use [Google Slides](http://slides.google.com) to run the slides, don’t worry about presenter view, and share my slide deck with a volunteer so they can track where we are at on a phone.

I also keep a TV on a stand (TV’s are getting very cheap) that I can roll into a Sunday school classroom if a teacher wants to use slides.

## 2. Use it as a signup kiosk for events.

Rather than a sign up sheet for an event, sometimes we will place a Chromebook on our back table and have it open in full screen to a signup form (we just use [Airtable](http://airtable.com) or [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)). That way, we have all of the signup info that we need readily available without the extra step of data entry. We’ll usually assign a volunteer to stand by the table to help people who may be unfamiliar with this.

## 3. Use it for writing sermon manuscripts.

I do about 90% of my writing on a Chromebook. I currently use [Dropbox Paper](http://paper.dropbox.com), but I’ve used [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com), [Microsoft Office 365](http://microsoft.com/office), [Evernote](http://evernote.com) and various Markdown editors in the past and they all work well. I usually keep two browser windows open, one with my writing and another with [Blue Letter Bible](http://blueletterbible.com)&nbsp;and [Kindle Cloud Reader](http://read.amazon.com).

## 4. Use it with a wall mounted TV for cheap digital signage.

You actually don’t NEED a Chromebook for this (a USB drive will do fine for most people.) But [there are several digital signage apps](https://enterprise.google.com/chrome/digital-signage/) built for Chromebooks and Chromeboxes you could use.

## 5. Use it as a loaner for people who need a computer.

Occasionally, people in the church need a computer for a couple days. Chromebooks are great for this because you can easily sign in to a Google account on any Chromebook and have it customized almost immediately with your bookmarks, etc. and if you need to wipe it clean (go back to factory settings) and restore, the whole process takes less than 10 minutes.

## 6. Use it to track Sunday School attendance.

You could use a Chromebook with an app like [Airtable](http://airtable.com) to track your Sunday School attendance. We don’t currently do this, but it’s something I’m planning on exploring in the future.

## 7. Use it to track book loans in a church library.

You could also use [Airtable](http://airtable.com) and a Chromebook as a simple checkout/library management system for a church library. You could take a picture of the book cover with the webcam. It would be fairly easy to share a read only table view of available books on your church website. Again, this is something I’m planning on exploring.

## 8. Use it to take down prayer requests during your prayer meeting.

You can use my [free Prayer Request organizer and Prayer Sheet generator](http://ryanhaydenwebsites.com/prayer-meeting.html)along with a Chromebook to take down prayer requests during (or right after) your prayer meeting. My wife does this every week.

## 9. Use it for recording sermons.

If you have a newer Chromebook with Android Apps, you could use one of [many audio recording apps](http://www.androidauthority.com/best-voice-recorder-apps-for-android-615332/)to quickly record and edit your sermon audio. I recommend [Airtable](http://airtable.com) as a great way to organize your sermons when you are done.

## 10. Use it to update your church websites and social media.

This use is kind of obvious - as both of these are done in the browser anyway.

## 11. Use it with an app like Canva to create flyers graphics and posters.

I’m a big fan of [Canva](http://canva.com). Even though I have used Adobe products for years, 90% of the time I make my flyers and posters in Canva now and often I do it on a Chromebook.

## 12. Use it with a Budget Spreadsheet to track church finances.

Our church’s financial secretary and treasurer keep track of our budget and expenses using a free spreadsheet from [Free Church Accounting](http://www.freechurchaccounting.com/). It’s not pretty, but it works surprisingly well. We just imported the Excel spreadsheet into google sheets and it allows us to view it at any time and get an up-to-date view of where we are at financially.
