This morning, someone who signed up for [Simple Church Planner](http://simplechurchplanner.com) asked about using Airtable to track church bus attendance.  I made a quick base for him and thought I'd share it with everyone.

[HERE IS THE LINK](https://airtable.com/shrr4AhcYQlGuGWgA) (Just copy the base to your account.)

<br>If you run buses in your church, this would be an easy way to track attendance as well as keep track of worker and rider contact info.  Bus Captains or workers could enter this using the Airtable app on their phone (iPhone or Android).
<br>
<br>It only took a minute, and I thought it was too good not to share.
