### Who We Are

We is me - Ryan Hayden.  I'm the pastor at Bible Baptist Church in Mattoon, IL and I've been making websites since 2004.  I'm faily unique, because I love programming and developement and I also love being a pastor.  The church I pastor isn't huge - it's one of the 80% of American churches with less than 100 regular attenders, so I know the struggles most churches face when it comes to volunteers and trying to maintain excellence.

### How We Came To Be

I spent years trying to start a company called Sitesforchurch making template based church websites.  It was a humbling experience and turned out to be way harder than I imagined it would be.  Eventually, I closed up shop and started [working for businesses](http://rowandtable.com) (which I still do).  

Two things brought me back:

* I have created some **[excellent custom website themes](http://sites.simplechurchtools.com)** and a system for church websites that I think can really help smaller churches and is unlike anything else out there.
* I keep making tools for my church to solve problems we are facing in our church.  (That's how all of our tools start.)  I know how much these tools have helped us, so I want to make them available to other churches.  

### Our Philosophy

I believe in simple tools that can help simple traditional churches.  I am not interested in making tools for churches that are super modern and have a large staff of tech guys.  (Although I wish them well.)  There are tools that do every one of the things my tools do and do them better - they are often just too complicated and expensive for simple churches.  **I hope you outgrow my tools.** When you do I know some great guys at other companies who can help you and I'd be happy to recomend them.

### Giving

50% of the sales from Simple Church Tools goes to fund missions trips and missions projects.  Right now I'm saving to help Camp Rhino in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
