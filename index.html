				<h2>Built by a pastor <strong>who knows and loves</strong> <em>regular</em> churches.</h2>
				<p>I'm Ryan Hayden, the guy behind Simple Church Tools.  I'm not just a web developer, I've been the pastor of a very normal and traditional church in Mattoon, IL since 2012.  Prior to that, I served as an assistant pastor, school teacher, children's pastor, Christian camp director and song leader.  <strong>I Love churches and want to help them any way I can.</strong></p>
				<p>My passion is to build simple tools that can help smaller churches grow and do what they do better.  <em>If your church has a large staff, a large budget, and a smoke machine on the stage - you can probably afford to use more complicated and expensive tools.</em>  But if one or two people are trying to do almost EVERYTHING around your church - <strong>my tools will help you save time, be consistent, and look good.</strong></p>
